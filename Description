📚 What is PageRank?
PageRank is an algorithm developed by Google to rank web pages based on their importance. 
The idea is:
A page is important if other important pages link to it.
It works like a "vote" system, but votes from important pages carry more weight.
📈 The PageRank Formula:
  PR(N) = (1 - d)/N + d * (sum of PR(from each incoming node) / outgoing links of that node)
🧠 Why MapReduce?
Because in real-world scenarios (like Google's web graph), the graph has billions of nodes and edges. So you can’t compute PageRank on a single machine — it needs parallel, distributed computing → That’s where MapReduce helps.

⚙️ How PageRank Fits into MapReduce
Think of it like a series of steps repeated multiple times (iterations), where in each iteration:
✅ Mappers do two things:
1.Send PageRank to neighbors (like giving out "importance points").
2.Pass along the structure of the graph (which node is linked to which others).
✅ Reducers do two things:
1.Collect all the votes (PageRank contributions) a node receives.
2.Calculate the new PageRank using the formula and emit updated PageRank with structure for the next iteration.

Simple Example:
  Dataset:
  A → B
  B → C
  C → A
All start with rank 1.0.

Iteration 1:
A gives rank to B → B gets 1.0
B gives to C → C gets 1.0
C gives to A → A gets 1.0 → All still have 1.0, but with more complex graphs, values keep redistributing until stable.
